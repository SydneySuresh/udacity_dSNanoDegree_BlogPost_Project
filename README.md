Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Blog Post Project 1

Installation:

No extra libraries are required beyond the latest Anaconda distribution. This project uses standard packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, and sklearn for data handling, visualisation, and modelling.

Project Motivation:

This project addresses critical healthcare challenges using CMS Nursing Home Compare data:

o	Predictive Accuracy: Can we predict quality scores with >99% accuracy?

o	Performance Drivers: What factors most influence quality scores?

o	Care Differences: How do short-stay vs long-stay metrics differ?


Results: 

Key Findings:

•	Achieved 99.9% accuracy (R²) across all quality measures

•	Identified Performance Ratio as strongest predictor

•	Short-stay metrics show 3x higher variance than long-stay
